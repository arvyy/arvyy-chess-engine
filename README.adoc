= Arvy chess engine

Homegrown chess engine in haskell with terrible performance. Engine can only go 5-6 ply deep before taking unacceptable amount of time for a move, which seems very low given the employed heurstics, and I wasn't able debug why. 5-ply deep search scored around 1600 elo on lichess.

Operates through UCI. Features:

1. Alpha / beta pruning;
2. Null move pruning;
3. Null-window pruning;
4. Late move removal pruning;
5. Iterative deepening;
6. PVS mainline caching;
7. Bitboards;
8. Piece-square tables valuation;
9. Mobility valuation;
10. Pawn structure valuation;
11. Quiescence search (including Delta pruning);
12. Killer moves;
